# üè¶ Advanced Financial Calculator

A comprehensive financial planning tool built with **Streamlit** that supports **combined investment strategies** including SIP, Lumpsum, and SWP (Systematic Withdrawal Plan) within the same phase, with advanced multi-phase investment planning.

## üöÄ Key Features

### üíº **Combined Investment Strategy**
Unlike traditional calculators that handle investments separately, this calculator allows you to combine multiple investment types within a single phase:

- **SIP + Lumpsum**: Start with a lumpsum and add monthly SIP investments
- **SIP + Lumpsum + SWP**: Build wealth with SIP & Lumpsum, then withdraw systematically
- **Flexible SWP Timing**: Start withdrawals from any year within the investment period
- **Automatic Integration**: All investments work together with unified returns calculation

### üìà **Investment Components**

#### SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)
- Monthly investment amount with optional annual step-up
- Compound growth with monthly compounding
- Flexible start and duration

#### Lumpsum Investment
- One-time investment amount
- Combines with rollover amounts from previous phases
- Compound growth calculation

#### SWP (Systematic Withdrawal Plan)
- Monthly withdrawals from the total invested corpus
- Start withdrawals from any specified year
- Remaining amount continues to earn returns
- No separate investment needed - uses combined SIP + Lumpsum corpus

### üîó **Multi-Phase Investment Planning**

#### Seamless Phase Transitions
- **Automatic Rollover**: Final amount from each phase becomes the starting corpus for the next
- **Additional Investments**: Add fresh money at the start of any new phase
- **Strategy Evolution**: Change investment approach across phases (e.g., accumulation ‚Üí withdrawal)

#### Real-World Scenarios
1. **Wealth Building ‚Üí Retirement**:
   - Phase 1: SIP ‚Çπ15,000/month + Lumpsum ‚Çπ5 lakhs for 25 years
   - Phase 2: SWP ‚Çπ75,000/month from the accumulated corpus for 20 years

2. **Aggressive Growth ‚Üí Balanced Approach**:
   - Phase 1: High SIP with 15% return expectation for 15 years
   - Phase 2: Conservative approach with 8% returns + partial SWP for 10 years

3. **Single Phase Combined Strategy**:
   - SIP ‚Çπ10,000/month + Lumpsum ‚Çπ2 lakhs for 15 years
   - SWP ‚Çπ25,000/month starting from year 10

## üßÆ Calculation Methodology

### SIP Calculation
- Uses compound interest with monthly compounding
- Supports annual step-up increases
- Formula: `FV = PMT √ó [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r] √ó (1 + r)`

### Lumpsum Calculation  
- Simple compound interest calculation
- Formula: `FV = PV √ó (1 + r)^n`

### SWP Calculation
- Monthly withdrawals from invested corpus
- Remaining amount earns monthly returns
- Tracks sustainability of withdrawal strategy
